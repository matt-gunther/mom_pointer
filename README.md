RMarkdown: functional programming to link maternal &amp; child records in nutrition data

This is an RStudio project containing an RMarkdown document that was used to build a blog-like static SHTML page explaining how to build pointer variables for Round 2 PMA nutrition data with R's functional programming toolkit, purrr. 

To recreate the page, open the project file and the Rmd file in RStudio. Click "knit", and then manually change the HTML output to SHTML. IPUMS CSS and an HTML header should be appended automatically.
